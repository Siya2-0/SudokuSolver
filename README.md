# SudokuSolver

SudokuSolver is a Java project that applies basic algorithms to solve Sudoku puzzles. Upon completing this assignment, you will have implemented various techniques to tackle Sudoku puzzles efficiently. Read the specification document to understand the project.

## Features

Linked List: Utilizes a linked list data structure to assist in solving Sudoku puzzles.
3D Sparse Table: Implements a 3D sparse table to create and represent the Sudoku board.
Iterative Methods: Utilizes iterative methods to solve Sudoku puzzles. It's important to note that due to complexity reasons, only three techniques are implemented. This means that most easy and medium Sudoku puzzles can be solved, but the algorithm may not always find the solution for more difficult puzzles that require additional techniques.

## Usage

To use SudokuSolver:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the Java files using your preferred IDE or compiler.
Run the compiled program and provide Sudoku puzzles to solve.


## Implementation Details

Linked List: The linked list data structure is utilized to efficiently manage and manipulate data throughout the Sudoku solving process.
3D Sparse Table: A 3D sparse table is employed to represent the Sudoku board, providing a structured approach to store and access puzzle elements.
Iterative Methods: The project implements iterative techniques to solve Sudoku puzzles, focusing on simplicity and efficiency for easy and medium difficulty puzzles.

## Limitations

While SudokuSolver can effectively solve most easy and medium difficulty puzzles, it may not always find a solution for more challenging puzzles that require advanced techniques.
The project is designed to showcase basic algorithmic approaches to Sudoku solving and may not encompass all possible solving strategies.
